# vanilla-js-todo-app

This is a client-side todo app coded in vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

The app uses localStorage to save todos the user created.

Todos can be added, marked as done and removed, and will persist after the page is refreshed or closed.

Clearing the site data or manually wiping the localStorage will clear the todo list.
